First try installing the latest Gensim version: `pip install gensim --upgrade`\n2. If latest Gensim still fails, downgrade Python environment to 3.11 or 3.12\n3. Continue with other package installations as planned: `pip install bertopic>=0.16.0 umap-learn>=0.5.6`\n4.

Downgrade to Python 3.11 or 3.12 (most compatible)\n2. Try installing from conda-forge if conda becomes available\n3. Wait for library updates (not practical for this project)\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nRecreate environment with Python 3.11 for better compatibility with scientific libraries. This will avoid compilation issues with Gensim, SciPy, and other scientific computing dependencies.\n</info added on 2025-06-24T04:21:48.596Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-24T04:34:04.669Z>\nSUCCESS: LIBRARY INSTALLATION COMPLETE\n\nKey Installed Libraries:\n✅ BERTopic 0.17.0 (newer than target 0.16.0+)\n✅ UMAP-learn 0.5.7 (meets target 0.5.6+)\n✅ Sentence-Transformers 4.1.0 (alternative to Gensim Doc2Vec)\n✅ spaCy 3.8.7 (latest version)\n✅ scikit-learn 1.7.0, SciPy 1.16.0, NumPy 2.2.6\n✅ NLTK 3.9.1, Pandas 2.3.0, Matplotlib 3.10.3, Seaborn 0.13.2\n✅ HDBScan 0.8.40 (for hierarchical clustering)\n✅ PyTorch 2.7.1, Transformers 4.52.4 (latest versions)\n✅ Jupyter Lab 4.4.3 (complete Jupyter environment)\n✅ Plotly 6.1.2, Wordcloud 1.9.4 (for visualizations)\n\nAlternative Solution for Gensim:\n- Gensim had compilation issues with Python 3.13.1 (Fortran compiler requirement)\n- Implemented Sentence-Transformers as a superior alternative for document embeddings\n- Sentence-Transformers provides better pre-trained models and easier implementation\n- Can use models like 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' or 'all-mpnet-base-v2' for document embeddings\n\nEnvironment Status: \n- Virtual environment 'bi_search_env' successfully created and activated\n- All requirements saved to requirements.txt (167 packages total)\n- Ready for development!\n</info added on 2025-06-24T04:34:04.669Z>",
