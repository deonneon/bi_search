# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** What are the latest best practices for Doc2Vec, BERTopic, and UMAP in 2024? Any recent improvements in document clustering and topic modeling for business intelligence metadata analysis? Include specific Python library versions and parameter tuning recommendations.

**Response:**

## Doc2Vec Best Practices and Recent Developments (2024)

**Library and Version**  
- Use Gensim (latest stable: 4.3.2 as of 2024) for Doc2Vec, as it remains the most robust and widely supported Python implementation[1][2][3].

**Preprocessing**  
- Thorough text cleaning is critical: lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, and stopword filtering (using NLTK 3.8.1 or spaCy 3.7+).
- Tokenization should be consistent and, for business metadata, consider custom tokenizers to handle domain-specific terms[3].

**Model Initialization and Training**  
- Use `gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument` for corpus preparation.
- Recommended starting parameters:
  - `vector_size`: 200–400 (300 is a strong default for business metadata)
  - `min_count`: 2–5 (higher for larger corpora)
  - `epochs`: 40–100 (more epochs for smaller or noisier datasets)
  - `dm`: 1 (Distributed Memory) is generally preferred for semantic tasks, but try `dm=0` (DBOW) for speed or when order is less important
  - `window`: 5–15 (larger for longer documents)
  - `workers`: set to the number of CPU cores for parallelism
- Always shuffle documents between epochs (`shuffle=True`).
- Use early stopping or monitor validation loss if possible to prevent overfitting[2][3].

**Parameter Tuning**  
- Grid search with `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` is recommended, but note that Doc2Vec is not natively scikit-learn compatible. Wrap the model in a custom estimator or use manual grid search.
- Tune `vector_size`, `window`, `min_count`, and `epochs` as primary parameters.
- Evaluate using:
  - Intrinsic: document similarity (cosine), analogy tasks
  - Extrinsic: downstream clustering or classification performance
- For business metadata, experiment with domain-specific stopword lists and phrase detection (bigrams/trigrams).

**Recent Improvements**  
- Gensim 4.x offers better memory efficiency and faster training.
- Use `infer_vector` with `epochs=20–50` for more stable inference on new documents.
- Consider hybrid approaches: combine Doc2Vec with transformer embeddings for improved semantic capture in business contexts.

## BERTopic Best Practices and Updates (2024)

**Library and Version**  
- Use BERTopic (latest stable: 0.16.0+ as of 2024), which now supports integration with HuggingFace Transformers, UMAP, and HDBSCAN out of the box.

**Embedding Models**  
- For business metadata, use domain-adapted transformer models (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or custom fine-tuned models).
- Set `embedding_model` parameter to a transformer for best results.

**Clustering and Topic Modeling**  
- UMAP is used for dimensionality reduction before clustering.
- HDBSCAN is the default clustering algorithm; tune `min_cluster_size` (5–30) and `min_samples` (5–15) for business datasets.
- Use `calculate_probabilities=True` for soft topic assignments, which helps with ambiguous business terms.

**Parameter Tuning**  
- UMAP: `n_neighbors=10–50`, `min_dist=0.0–0.5`, `n_components=2–5`
- HDBSCAN: `min_cluster_size=5–30`, `min_samples=5–15`
- BERTopic: `nr_topics` can be set to reduce the number of topics post hoc (e.g., `nr_topics=20` for concise summaries).

**Recent Improvements**  
- BERTopic now supports dynamic topic reduction and improved topic merging.
- Integration with KeyBERT for better topic keyword extraction.
- Improved visualization tools for interactive topic exploration.

## UMAP Best Practices and Updates (2024)

**Library and Version**  
- Use umap-learn (latest stable: 0.5.6+ as of 2024).

**Parameter Recommendations**  
- `n_neighbors`: 10–50 (smaller values preserve local structure, larger values global structure)
- `min_dist`: 0.0–0.5 (lower values yield tighter clusters)
- `n_components`: 2 or 3 for visualization; higher for downstream clustering
- `metric`: 'cosine' is preferred for text embeddings
- Set `random_state` for reproducibility

**Tuning and Evaluation**  
- Use grid search or Bayesian optimization for `n_neighbors` and `min_dist`.
- Evaluate embedding quality with trustworthiness, continuity, and visual inspection.
- For business metadata, experiment with higher `n_neighbors` to capture broader semantic relationships.

**Recent Improvements**  
- Faster fitting and lower memory usage in recent versions.
- Better support for sparse and large datasets.
- Enhanced integration with scikit-learn pipelines for parameter tuning.

## Document Clustering and Topic Modeling for Business Intelligence Metadata

**Recent Advances**  
- Hybrid models: Combining transformer embeddings (e.g., SBERT) with UMAP+HDBSCAN or KMeans for robust clustering.
- BERTopic’s dynamic topic reduction and improved keyword extraction are particularly effective for business metadata, where topics can be highly overlapping.
- Use of custom stopword lists and phrase detection to improve topic coherence in business contexts.
- Visualization: Use BERTopic’s interactive visualizations or UMAP plots to validate cluster/topic quality.

**Recommended Pipeline (2024)**

1. **Preprocess metadata**: Clean, normalize, and tokenize using pandas, NLTK, or spaCy.
2. **Embed documents**: Use Doc2Vec (Gensim 4.3.2) or transformer-based embeddings.
3. **Dimensionality reduction**: Apply UMAP (umap-learn 0.5.6+) with tuned parameters.
4. **Clustering**: Use HDBSCAN (for BERTopic) or KMeans (for Doc2Vec/UMAP pipeline).
5. **Topic modeling**: Use BERTopic (0.16.0+) for interpretable topics and summaries.
6. **Evaluation**: Use both intrinsic (coherence, silhouette) and extrinsic (business relevance, manual inspection) metrics.

## Example: Parameter Grid for GridSearchCV

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import ParameterGrid

param_grid = {
    'vector_size': [200, 300, 400],
    'window': [5, 10, 15],
    'min_count': [2, 5],
    'epochs': [40, 60, 80]
}
for params in ParameterGrid(param_grid):
    model = Doc2Vec(**params)
    # Train and evaluate model
```

## Key Python Library Versions (2024)

| Library         | Recommended Version |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| gensim          | 4.3.2              |
| umap-learn      | 0.5.6              |
| bertopic        | 0.16.0             |
| hdbscan         | 0.8.33             |
| sentence-transformers | 2.6.1         |
| nltk            | 3.8.1              |
| pandas          | 2.2.2              |
| scikit-learn    | 1.5.0              |

## Edge Cases and Pitfalls

- **Small datasets**: Doc2Vec and BERTopic may overfit; use more epochs but regularize and validate carefully.
- **Highly imbalanced clusters**: Tune HDBSCAN’s `min_cluster_size` and use BERTopic’s topic reduction.
- **Ambiguous business terms**: Use domain-specific embeddings and custom stopword lists.
- **Reproducibility**: Always set `random_state` for UMAP, HDBSCAN, and other stochastic processes.

## Actionable Recommendations for This Project

- For Task 4, implement Doc2Vec with a parameter grid as above, using Gensim 4.3.2 and custom wrappers for grid search.
- For Task 5, use UMAP 0.5.6+ with `metric='cosine'`, and tune `n_neighbors` and `min_dist` for your metadata.
- For topic modeling and clustering, use BERTopic 0.16.0+ with transformer embeddings and HDBSCAN, tuning `min_cluster_size` and `min_samples` for your dataset size.
- Integrate parameter selection into your ipywidgets configuration (Task 14) for easy experimentation.

These practices reflect the latest state-of-the-art for document clustering and topic modeling in business intelligence metadata analysis as of 2024[1][2][3].
